# Assignment #1

- Read a file that contains characters only “0” or “1” 
  - E.g., 0101010101000001010100101111010101000100101010111010101010
- File name that your program needs to read is “input”
- Store the data in the memory in each “bit” and represent the data in
the file using various data types in C
- Don’t assume the size of the input file (it can be a huge file)
